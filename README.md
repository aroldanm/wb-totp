# WB-TOTP (Word-Based Time-Based One-Time Password)

**WB-TOTP** is a human-friendly alternative to the standard TOTP (RFC 6238) that generates **time-based one-time passwords using readable words** instead of numeric codes.

> ‚úÖ Uses the same time-based HMAC logic as TOTP  
> ‚úÖ But outputs tokens like `moon-coffee` that are easier to say, hear, and remember

## Why WB-TOTP?

### 1. Strong cryptography, better usability

WB-TOTP is based on secure cryptography (HMAC + time sync), but optimized for human interaction:

- Easier to pronounce, share, and recall
- Ideal for voice-based or informal settings
- Reduces the chance of miscommunication and human error

### 2. Protects against voice impersonation

With modern AI, anyone's voice can be cloned. Trusting a voice alone is no longer secure:

- WB-TOTP adds a verifiable, time-based verbal token
- Only someone with the shared secret can generate the right words
- Even perfect voice impersonators can‚Äôt guess the token

---

## Use Cases

### üìû Voice Authentication

- Someone calls you pretending to be a known contact.
- You ask for the current word token to verify their identity.
- You verify that the code they share is the same one you generated on your end.

### ü§ù Peer-to-Peer Verification

- Two people who don't know each other verify their identity using a spoken token.
- If both have the same set of words, the identity is verified.

### üì¶ Package Delivery Verification

- A courier arrives claiming to deliver an item.
- Request the WB-TOTP token (shared when placing the order).
- They verify the code before delivering the package.

## How it works

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Generate the secret

Before two users can verify each other using WB-TOTP, they must share a common dictionary of words:

1. A **unique dictionary** (list of words) is generated with 100 or more simple words, in an **unique ordered list**. This dictionary is **encoded in base32**, creating a compact and secure string.

Example:
```
// Dictionary of simple words

"cat, dog, book, sun, tree, car, milk, ball, hat, fish"

// Encoded dictionary by base32

ImNhdCwgZG9nLCBib29rLCBzdW4sIHRyZWUsIGNhciwgbWlsaywgYmFsbCwgaGF0LCBmaXNoIg==

```

3. A WB-TOTP URI is created containing the encoded dictionary and relevant configuration parameters. This URI is shared with the other user, who stores the dictionary locally and securelly.

Once both users have the same dictionary, they can independently generate synchronized word tokens based on time.

#### URI Format

WB-TOTP extends the otpauth:// URI format with the following structure:

```
otpauth://wbtotp/[LABEL]?secret=[DICTIONARY]&issuer=[ISSUER]&algorithm=[ALGORITHM]&words=[WORDS]&period=[PERIOD]

```
| Parameter | Description | Is required |
|---|---|---|
|`LABEL`|Name or identifier of the recipient ‚Äî the person whose identity will be verified|YES|
|`DICTIONARY`|A `BASE32`-encoded string containing the shared and ordered dictionary used to generate the tokens|YES|
|`ISSUER`|Name or identifier of the sender ‚Äî the person who generated and shared the dictionary|YES|
|`ALGORITHM`|Hash algorithm used to generate tokens. Default: `SHA1`. Alternatives: `SHA256`, `SHA512`|NO|
|`WORDS`|Number of words per token. Default: `2`. Must be ‚â•1|NO|
|`PERIOD`|Duration of each token in seconds. Default: `30`. Alternatives: `60`|NO|

##### Examples

This URI represents a dictionary created by David, intended to verify the identity of Pablo, using 2 words per token, with a new token generated every 30 seconds.

```
otpauth://wbtotp/Pablo?secret=ImNhdCwgZG9nLCBib29rLCBzdW4sIHRyZWUsIGNhciwgbWlsaywgYmFsbCwgaGF0LCBmaXNoIg==&issuer=David&algorithm=SHA1&words=2&period=30
```

or short URI

```
otpauth://wbtotp/Pablo?secret=ImNhdCwgZG9nLCBib29rLCBzdW4sIHRyZWUsIGNhciwgbWlsaywgYmFsbCwgaGF0LCBmaXNoIg&issuer=David
```

#### Recomendations

Sharing information using a QR code is a better option than using the URI directly, since the base32 hash generated can be very large and complet to share as a link or text.


### ‚¨áÔ∏è Verify the identity

Once both users have the same secret dictionary stored, verifying someone‚Äôs identity becomes a simple, secure process. The verification is stateless, synchronized by time, and uses human-readable tokens.

#### How tokens are generated

To generate a token, both users independently follow the same deterministic steps:

1. Decode the dictionary
The base32-encoded dictionary string is decoded into a list of words (in a specific order).

```
// From base32

ImNhdCwgZG9nLCBib29rLCBzdW4sIHRyZWUsIGNhciwgbWlsaywgYmFsbCwgaGF0LCBmaXNoIg==

// To dictionary

"cat, dog, book, sun, tree, car, milk, ball, hat, fish"
```

3. Get current timestamp
Compute the current time interval based on the period (default: 30 seconds).

```
timecode = floor(currentUnixTime / period)
```

3. Generate HMAC hash
Use the decoded dictionary (as raw data) as the key.
Generate a HMAC using the configured algorithm (default: SHA1) with timecode as the message:

```
hash = HMAC-SHA1(key: dictionaryBytes, message: timecode)
```

4. Extract word indexes
Derive indexes from the hash to select words from the dictionary.
If the same index repeats, the second index is incremented (+1) to avoid word duplication.

5. Return words as token
The selected words are combined as the final token:
```
Token = "cat-sun"
```
Because the input values (dictionary, time, algorithm, period) are exactly the same on both devices, the output token will match ‚Äî without any online communication.

### üß™ Example
Two users have the following WB-TOTP URI:

```
otpauth://wbtotp/Pablo?secret=ImNhdCwgZG9nLCBib29rLCBzdW4sIHRyZWUsIGNhciwgbWlsaywgYmFsbCwgaGF0LCBmaXNoIg==&issuer=David&algorithm=SHA1&words=2&period=30
```

Then, at time 12:00:00, both generate the token:

```
"cat-sun"
```

At 12:00:31, the token changes automatically:

```
"fish-car"
```

## Dictionary Generation

This is a guidance about how generate the dictionary of words, you can do other approach but always folling this rules. 

Given two users want to connect, they:

1. Randomly select 100 words or more.

```
// From the original dictionary with 255 simple words

"cat, dog, book, sun, tree, car, milk, ball, hat, fish, ..., chrown (255)

// Just select 100 random words

"apple, hat, bird, shoe, house, water, book, dog, lamp, ..., cat (100)
```

3. Apply a random but deterministic order.

```
"lamp, bird, apple, house, dog, shoe, cat, water, hat, ..., book"
```

5. Encode it in Base32 to generate the dictionary secret.

```
// base32 dictionary

ImNhdCwgZG9nLCBib29rLCBzdW4sIHRyZWUsIGNhciwgbWlsaywgYmFsbCwgaGF0LCBmaXNoLCBsYW1wLCBiaXJkLCBhcHBsZSwgaG91c2UsIGRvZywgc2hvZSwgY2F0LCB3YXRlciwgaGF0LCBib29rLCAiY2F0LCBkb2csIGJvb2ssIHN1biwgdHJlZSwgY2FyLCBtaWxrLCBiYWxsLCBoYXQsIGZpc2gsIGxhbXAsIGJpcmQsIGFwcGxlLCBob3VzZSwgZG9nLCBzaG9lLCBjYXQsIHdhdGVyLCBoYXQsIGJvb2ssICJjYXQsIGRL==
```

Each connection generates a unique dictionary and thus unique tokens, this keeps each user-to-user channel secure and personalized.
